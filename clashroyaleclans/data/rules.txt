**Here are some Legend Family Discord server rules.**

:fire:No Hateful, obscene, offensive, racist, sexual or violent words allowed in chat or images.
:fire:Respect others' opinions. If you disagree, please do so in a constructive manner.
:fire:This is an English only server, please use any other languages in a private message.
:fire:Do not spam, and avoid ever using @myclanname without permission from clan managers or deputies.
:fire:No advertisement of any kind, e.g. clans, websites, discord invites.
:fire:Use #bot-spam for bot features, e.g. !deck or !payday
:fire:Obtaining credits or reputations using unethical ways like cheating or trading is strictly forbidden
:fire:Respect and do not subvert moderators and managers.
:fire:A good rule is to talk to people as if you were talking to them face to face.
:fire:There are more rules that vary from clan to clan. Ask your clan leader for the rules of your clan.\n

**Clan Transfer**\n
:fire:If you are transferring from one Legend Family clan to another, please contact your destination clan's clan leader first, 
	and wait for the all clear from that clan leader. We are all for members being wherever they want to be, but it helps us keep track of what is going on, and helps us make sure you get accepted.
:fire:If you are leaving the clan for another reason, please talk with your leader first when possible. As a clan leader it helps to know if you're leaving for good, if you're leaving to do 2v2 with a few friends for a while, or if you're leaving for an eSport event.\n

**Violation of these roles will lead to punishment including temporary guest role reduced access, temporary kick from server, or permanent kick from server, depending on the severity and/or frequency of the offense**
